## A
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - also known as machine intelligence, is a type of computer science focused on designing intelligent computer systems that exhibit characteristics of human behavior. AI is an academic discipline that has multiple sub-fields such as Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, Robotics, Speech Processing, Machine Learning.
- **Automatic Speech Recognition** - is also known as Speech-To-Text or computer speech recognition. It is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that enables the recognition and translation of auditory utterance to text.

## B

## C
- **Channel** - an interface and origin of communication. It is where the utterances are received. Examples: smart devices, mobile phones, web sites, mobile app, etc.
- **Conversational AI** - is the set of technologies to enable automated communication between computers and humans. This communication can be speech and text. Conversational AI recognizes speech and text, understands intent, decipher various languages, and responds where it mimics human conversation. In some cases, it is also known as Natural Language Processing.
- **Conversational Platform** - the system or services that handle the two-way interaction with the user and the entity.  The platform owns the task of understanding the user's utterance, translating it to humans, and machine exchange, and making sure it is reaching the right entity. 
- **Component Interoperability** - A component of a platform may be replaced by another component from a different vendor.  I.e., replace the TTS by another TTS from a different vendor.

## D
- **Dialog Broker (DB)** - is responsible for providing the fulfillable intents available for a resolved VRS record (e.g. where resolved VRS record "BigGrocery", it’s fulfillable intents might be "order product, check order status, add to shopping list". These fulfillable intents can execute remotely on the DM or download locally on the device.
- **Dialog Manager (DM)** - handles the dynamic response of the conversation. It provides a more personalized response based on the action provided by the NLP to send back to the user.
- **Disambiguate** - when the conversational platform hypothesizes two or more possible resolutions to a user utterance, it may ask the user for additional clarification or choose between the various interpretations to decide the user's correct intention. 


## E
- **Entity** - is a part of the structured machine translation. It is a custom level data type and considered a concrete value to associate a word in a query. This is also known as annotations.
- **Entity** -  government or private/public company that provides certain businesses or services.
- **Explicit Invocation** - an invocation type where the user invokes the channel, and it is explicitly stating a direct command to accomplish a specific task. The direct authority is to communicate directly to a registered voice application.

## F
## G
## H
## I
- **Invocation** - is part of the construct of the user's utterance during a conversation with a channel. An invocation describes a specific function that the guest wants and expecting a particular response.
- **Intent** - is a part of the structured machine translation. It is the identified action that the machine interprets based on the user's query. This is also known as classifiers.
- **Implicit Invocation** - an invocation type where the user invokes the channel, and use the most common words or indirectly saying the explicit Invocation. 

## J
## K
## L
## M
## N
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** - a service and a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers communicate with humans in their language and scales other language-related tasks. NLP helps structure highly complicated, unstructured human utterance and vice-versa. Natural Language Understanding is a subset of NLP that is responsible for understanding the meaning of the user's utterance and classifying it into proper intents.

## O
## P
- **Platform** - The collection of components (the environment) needed to execute a voice application.  Examples of platforms include the Amazon and Google platforms that execute voice applications.

## Q
- **Query** - user’s word requesting for specific function and expecting a particular response.

## R
## S
- **Speech-To-Text (STT)** - is converting the response from an audio to a text.

## T
- **Text-To-Speech (TTS)** - is a text converting to audio. Also known as Automatic Speech Recognition. It includes customized models to overcome common speech recognition barriers, such as unique vocabularies, speaking styles, or background noise.
- **Technical Resource** -  it can be a publisher/developer. It can be a representative of an entity or independent party. Their role is to create an actual listing of the voice application.

## U
- **Utterance** - spoken or typed phrases.
- **User** - a person who interacts with channels.  

## V
- **Voice Application** - also known as skill, action, capsule or domain. This is the specific executable component that has association to multiple things such as invocation, collection of related intents and entities up to the configuration to your dialog manager.
- **Voice Application Interoperability** – a voice application involves another voice application.
- **Voice Assistant System** A system where a user (primarily) uses his/her voice to interact with an automated conversational assistant for information or to control devices. 
- **Voice Registry System (VRS)** - is a global entity type in OVN and considered one of the most central components. It is a registry system with similarities to Domain Name System (DNS), but for voice. VRS resolves requests to dialog management endpoints, NLP providers, and the dialog broker. VRS serves consistently regardless of the NLP.


## W
- **Wake Word** - a specific word that will catch the attention of the channel.

## Y
## Z

These graphics will be used to instill the common OVN vocabulary across all the OVN Committees and Communities.
